10 glossy rays per reflection only allowing 2 depth to make it fast to debug....And depth of refraction is 3, so 2 rays on that.

you can see the reflection is glossy through the edge of the spheres (they are somewhat blurred instead of completely sharp)
The noisy spheres is dark in the reflection just because of sampling issues..... the function seems to have a circling noise effect, with either black or white as a major color.... Anyway, it should just be a noise function issue and function of random sampling of glossy reflection issue, shouldn't be much of a problem.

It takes about 3 minutes to render.
